## Portkey DID
### What is Portkey DID?

Portkey is a social recovery supported DID solution that expedites Web2 users' entrance into Web3, enabling them to create decentralized identities and manage their digital assets. The Web2-like experience guarantees that everyone can get involved without having to memorize the seed phrases and mnemonics that are typical in the blockchain world. To make it better, users have complete control over their possessions at nearly zero costs, and their assets are safeguarded by people they trust.

### Why Portkey DID?

Read below the key features that will surely fascinate you:

- Familiar Web2 signup & login

Crypto wallets and digital identities are considered hard to use for several reasons, and among all the troublesome user experiences, signup and login might be the most intimidating. Common crypto wallets require users to remember a series of words, known as seed phrase, when they register, and the phrase must be kept safe ever after. Once the seed phrase is lost or leaked to others, the owners may lose control over their assets. The whole procedure: remembering the seed phrase, writing it down, and keeping it safe must be strictly followed while users create a crypto address. Otherwise, the assets will be exposed to risks like theft, hacking, and rendered non-recoverable. And when users want to access the address from other devices, the seed phrase will be used again.
Portkey DID solution exempts users from all these sophisticated operations by bringing the Web2 experiences to Web3. Users can register identities using their emails, phone numbers, and social media accounts, including Gmail accounts, Apple accounts, and more. And once the identity has been created, they can log in on other devices by simply scanning the QR code. The whole process is seed phrase free. With Portkey, all users can have the best of Web3 without having to remember and store seed phrases.

- Social recovery

With the help of Portkey, seed phrases are no longer needed to create and access addresses. Then how can users recover their assets after they have logged out? The answer is through "social recovery". As the name suggests, assets are recovered through social means. Once users have registered an account, they can appoint their other accounts or their families and friends as guardians. Guardians are mainly responsible for helping owners gain access to their accounts. When a user needs to log in, for instance, guardians will receive requests from this user, asking them to approve this action. Only after obtaining approval from a certain percentage of all the guardians can this operation be executed.
Social recovery is an effective solution to the problem that traditional crypto wallets are inconvenient to access and impossible to recover once the seed phrases are lost. Portkey implements this mechanism and lets users themselves choose the guardians they trust. This way, users' identities and assets are protected by the guardians, and they can recover possessions within minutes in case of attacks or thefts.

- Near 0 Cost

Crypto wallets that support social recovery are usually not free to use. Users might be charged for creating accounts or managing assets. While Portkey users can own their Web3 identities and use Portkey at no charge. The creation of on-chain contract accounts that represent decentralized identities is completely free. With these identities, they can browse through Web3 DApps available on Portkey smoothly.

- Multi-chain support

Portkey supports the management of identities and assets on multiple chains. Users can use Portkey to interact with networks like aelf, Ethereum, BSC, EVM chains, etc, and more blockchains will be constantly added.

- Crypto-fiat trading

Portkey enables users to buy cryptocurrencies, like tokens and NFT, with fiat money via credit card or bank transfer, or vice versa.
